# smoothpacman
non-pixelated version of pacman in 600 lines of code. 
this is something I made from scratch, completely rendered in java graphics, no external images used.

Uses:\
Object-Oriented programming\
2D Array to store data for the map\
Randomness for ghost movements





required:
openjdk 11.0.12 64-Bit\
org.json library


note: the sound and video are not synched in this recording for some reason. in the game they are.
